Lecture- Structure Analysis: Structure analyses differences in the distribution of genetic variants amongst populations with a Bayesian iterative algorithm by placing samples into groups whose members share similar patterns of variation.

Laboratory 5- Setting up a PCR Reaction with Bacterial Cultures: Setting up a Taq primer mixture to set up the reaction and preparing the PCR tubes with enzymes and cells inside. Placing the PCR tubes in the thermal cycler with an initial denaturation at 94C, amplification at 52C, and additional elongation at 72C.
Laboratory 6A- Pour on gels, videos on loading gel: Preparing the TAE agarose gel by preparing the TAE buffer in the microwave, adding EtBr to the agarose gel mix, and pouring the agarose into the gel casting for it to cool.

Lecture- Next gene sequencing: Next-generation sequencing (NGS) is a massively parallel sequencing technology that offers ultra-high throughput, scalability, and speed. The technology is used to determine the order of nucleotides in entire genomes or targeted regions of DNA or RNA.
