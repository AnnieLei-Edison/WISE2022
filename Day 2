Lecture: Cloning, plasmids
Plasmid cloning is one of the most commonly used techniques in molecular biology research. It plays a crucial role in studying the structure, function, and evolution of geneswhile serving as an essential tool in genetic, protein, and metabolic engineering.
Laboratory 2F- Determine the concentration of DNA by UV light absorbance: Obtaining microfuge tubes for diluted unkown DNA stick to then put in a specyrophotometer to measure and record the absorbance of the DNA samples at 260 nm. Using formula: Dilution factor x absorbance x 50 = Original Stock absorbance.
Sample(1/10 dilution): OD260= 1.630
10*1.63*50 = 815
Sample(1/100 dilution): OD260= 0.166
100*0.166*50 = 830
Laboratory 4- Inoculation of Bacterial Cultures: Examine the plates with the cDNA Library, specifically picking the colored white cultures as those are the ones with inserts in them. The colonies(white) are taken from the plate using a sterile stick to inoculate the media in tubes for incubation and growth.
Lecture: Libraries PCR
Libraries are screened with different probes to isolate target genes or sequences. These probes can be a particular sequence such as a cDNA, a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) product, or a genomic fragment.
Report and presentation on the DNA assay and spectrophotometer results.
