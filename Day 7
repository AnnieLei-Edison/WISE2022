Laboratory 1- Pipetting and Measuring: Firstly we practiced transferring liquids 1 ml or more using the pipet bulbs. Then transfer liquids up to 1 ml with the pipettor P-20, P-200, and P-1000. Practicing how to read volume for the three pipetmanns. Weigh 10ml with the P1000 and P200 micropipettes to test the pipetting accuracy. Pipetting spots with the P20.
