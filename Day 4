Lecture: DSAP Introduction Quality and cropping
Laboratory 7- Plasmid DNA Minipreps: 
Students resuspend the culture and microcentrifuge 1.5 ml for the supernatant and pellet and remove the supernatant multiple times after putting buffers and solutions inside, continuing to centrifuge. Till only the remaining is left and separated with 60ul of buffer EB. The plasmid DNA is now separated for the restriction digests.
Laboratory 8-Setting up Restriction Digests:
Prepare a 3X Mix and add to the miniprep DNA and then add loading dye after incubating at 37C.
Lab 9B- Running an Agarose Gel for the Restriction DIgests:
Prepare TAE agarose gel, prepare samples and load gel, and interpret restriction digest reactions to measure the length of base pairs.
Lab 4- Set up inoculation of bacterial culture
