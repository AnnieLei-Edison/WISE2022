Lecture- Introduction: A presentation and lecture on DNA structure and gene expression along with a quick review of what the program is. A discussion of the day's scheduled labs of pipetting, DNA concentration, and plating a cDNA bacterial library.
Lab Safety: Inventory of Equipment and Supplies
Pipetting Demonstration
Laboratory 1- Pipetting and Measuring: Firstly we practiced transferring liquids 1 ml or more using the pipet bulbs. Then transfer liquids up to 1 ml with the pipettor P-20, P-200, and P-1000. Practicing how to read volume for the three pipetmanns. Weigh 10ml with the P1000 and P200 micropipettes to test the pipetting accuracy. Pipetting spots with the P20. 
Lecture on DNA Structure and Cloning: I took notes on how DNA cloning is the process of making multiple, identical copies of a particular piece of DNA. In a typical DNA cloning procedure, the gene or other DNA fragment of interest is first inserted into a circular piece of DNA called a plasmid.
Laboratory 2- Determining DNA Concentrations: Using ethidium bromide to intercalate between the DNA bases and emits fluorescence. Determine the DNA concentration of the Unknown DNA using the value of the absorbance. Using fluid dilutions and interpreting sport assays.
Laboratory 3- Plating an L. punctata cDNA Library: Screening a library of cDNA clones from the duckweed L. punctata. Spreading bacteria containing plasmids with genes from L. punctata onto the Petri plate to grow colonies.
