Lecture: Minipreps, PCR Mapping problems
Going over instructions like lysing cells completely and not vortexing the cells after lysis.
Laboratory 5- Setting up a PCR Reaction with Bacterial Cultures:
Setting up a Taq primer mixture to set up the reaction and preparing the PCR tubes with enzymes and cells inside. Placing the PCR tubes in the thermal cycler with an initial denaturation at 94C, amplification at 52C, and additional elongation at 72C.
Laboratory 6A- Pour on gels, videos on loading gel: 
Preparing the TAE agarose gel by preparing the TAE buffer in the microwave, adding EtBr to the agarose gel mix, and pouring the agarose into the gel casting for it to cool.
Lecture: Restriction enzymes
Laboratory 6B- Run gel PCR: 
Preparing the samples and loading the agarose gel with DNA samples inside. Then turn on the gel box with lead and voltage at 150 volts.
